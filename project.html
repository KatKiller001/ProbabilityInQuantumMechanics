        <h2>Dualism wave-particle</h2>
        <h3>One of the first steps towards this theory was done in 1801, by Thomas Young.</h3>
        <h3>In his experiment, Young placed a monochromatic light source that shines through two gaps, at a distance comparable to the wavelength of the light, onto a screen that registers the photon position.</h3>
        <h3>If the light intensity is low, the photons appear to behave like particles, colliding with the screen at random spots.</h3>
        <h3>If the light intensity is high, the photons that collide onto the screen respect the pattern of wave interference.</h3>
        <h3>This experiment settled the centuries-long debate about the composition of light, stating its dualistic nature.</h3>

        <h2>Quantization of energy</h2>
        <h3>In the early 1900s, with the experiments on the photoelectric phenomenon, it was discovered that energy was not a continuous quantity, but it was quantized.</h3>
        <h3>The experiment consisted in shining a monochromatic light onto a metallic surface.</h3>
        <h3>The metallic surface released electrons inversely proportional to the light source wavelength, but the effect observed would not occur if the frequency didn't surpass a minimum value, even if the light was shined for prolonged periods.</h3>
        <h3>This discovery showed that energy was not transferred in a continuous way, but it was transmitted in packets.</h3>

        <h2>Schrodinger equation</h2>
        <h3>De Broglie extended the dualism wave-particle to all corps, and correlated the mass of a corp and the wave function associated with it in an inversely proportional manner.</h3>
        <h3>With this interpretation the wavelength of macro objects is negligible, but for elementary particles calculating the associated wave function becomes fundamental for studying them.</h3>
        <h3>The equation that describes waves of matter was found by Schrodinger in 1926.</h3>
        <h3>This equation, if calculated, gives us a complex quantity that describes the wave, but Schrodinger didn't explain what this wave was.</h3>
        <h3>The physicist that explained what this wave was was Max Born, in particular he said  that the waves of matter were waves of probability.</h3>
        <h3>If we consider the square of Schrodinger's equation we obtain a real positive quantity that represents  the probability of locating a particle in a given position.</h3>
